# python-pentesting-tools

A repo dedicated to learning more about networking and security containing pentesting tools written in Python3.<br /><br />

Contents:<br />
  Port-Scanner,<br />
  TCP Client/Server,<br />
  Web Server will be added after the TCP sockets as well.<br />

Port Scanner: Run with "python PortScanner.py" it will then prompt user input for addresses, etc.<br /><br />

TCP Server/Client: Run with "python client.py" and "python server.py" client.py supports server responses or user input. The server.py file does not allow for user input as, in theory, it will not be on the same system. Client commands // os - returns server operating system, exit - safely closes connection between server and client.<br /><br />
