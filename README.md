# python-pentesting-tools

A repo dedicated to learning more about networking and security containing pentesting tools written in Python3.<br /><br />

Contents:<br />
  Port-Scanner,<br />
  TCP Client/Server,<br />
  Web Server will be added after the TCP sockets as well.<br />

Port Scanner:<br /> 
 -- Run with "python PortScanner.py" it will then prompt user input for addresses, etc.<br />

TCP Server/Client (devices need to be on the same network):<br /> 
 -- server.py -- The server can be run on any machine OS, does not allow for user input to send to client. use python server.py to start the server (server must be start before the client)<br />
 -- client.py -- The client must be run on a linux based machine as python 3 select() function does not support windows at the moment. The client supports both user input and server responses. Client commands // os - returns the server operating system, exit - safely closes connection between server and client. <br />

 Web Server:<br />
  -- STILL IN DEVELOPMENT, NOT FULLY FUNCTIONAL I DO NOT RECOMMEND RUNNING THIS YET.
  -- Contains simple index.html file to serve to client (W.I.P.)
